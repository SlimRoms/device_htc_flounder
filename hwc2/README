This hardware composer implements version 2.0. It is to be used as a reference
guide for writing HWC 2.0 implementations. It is a 2D HAL (no GL acceleration).
Enabling it will degrade performance. The NVIDIA hardware composer is still the
supported hwcomposer for flounder.

Future hardware composers should be written using drm_hwcomposer.

To enable, add "TARGET_USES_HWC2 := true" to flounder's BoardConfig.mk.
To disable, remove "TARGET_USES_HWC2 := true" and run "make installclean"
